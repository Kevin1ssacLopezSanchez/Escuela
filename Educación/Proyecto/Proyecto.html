        <h1>RUSSIAN-UCRANIAN CONFLICT</h1>
        <P>The Russo-Ukrainian War is a military conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, which is currently ongoing and which increased after the tense period of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis of 2021-2022, a conflict that on February 24, 2022 It finally led to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, although this confrontation has been going on since 2014 and has had several stages, including Crimea's accession to Russia and the Donbass war that began that same year and is still in progress. Likewise, the Euromaidan demonstrations that mark the beginning of the Ukrainian conflict began in November 2013 in kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, due to the suspension of the signing of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union.
<br><br>
On February 22, 2014, after several months of protests and riots and after the so-called Black Thursday (February 20) in which more than 60 demonstrators died, opponents took control of the country and irregularly occupied the main institutions based in kyiv. Next, the Verkhovna Rada took control of the country in the absence of a good part of its members and Oleksandr Turchínov assumed the coordination of the Government and the presidency of the Parliament, thus falling the government of Víktor Yanukovych.</P>

<h2>CONTEXT</h2>
<p>
    The Russification of Ukraine was a body of laws, decrees and other actions carried out, first by the Imperial Russian authorities and later by the Soviet ones, to strengthen the Russian position in the national, political and linguistic spheres in Ukraine. Russification has been seen as part of a policy of genocide related to the Holodomor famine by Raphael Lemkin and other sources.
<br><br>
The creation of the Black Sea Fleet is attributed to Grigori Potemkin on May 13, 1783, after the annexation of Crimea under the reign of Catherine the Great and the creation of an important military base, located in the city of Sevastopol (recently annexed to the Russian Federation since March 2014).

<h2>FIRST PHASE</h2>
<h3>ACCESSION OF CRIMEA TO RUSSIA</h3>
<p>
    Crimea's accession to Russia is the process of incorporating the two entities that make up the Crimean peninsula, the Republic of Crimea and the autonomous city of Sevastopol, as federal subjects of the Russian Federation.

    In accordance with the Law on New Federal Territories of the Russian legislation that was applied to the peninsula, it can be considered part of Russia from the moment of the signing of the interstate agreement on March 18, 2014. In addition, the transitional period will last until on January 1, 2015.
    <br><br>
    By invading and annexing Crimea, Russia violated an international treaty and three bilateral treaties signed with Ukraine: the Budapest Memorandum —which offered security guarantees by its signatories to Ukraine—; the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Ukraine and Russia of 1997; the Treaty on the permanence of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Ukrainian territory until 2017 and the Kharkov Treaty by which said permanence was extended until 2042.
